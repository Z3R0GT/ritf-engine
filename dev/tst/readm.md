To test the algorithm, go to the "/game/mods/" folder, create a new folder (you can give it any name).

inside the folder you created, now create a new file called "base.info" (it must has to have that name and extension)

Open the file, and in order to create the mod, you just have to follow the following instructions:

Variables inside square brackets can use commas or hyphens to separate data (Note: both variables must have the same amount of data)

name of the file to modify, [line number], [tag name], [should the mod have full control? (you can only enter: y/n)];

i.e:
chapter1.rpy,           [33],           [other],              [n]                  ;
archive name to mod,  line to jump,    label to jump,   Â¿has total control?,      end-start of the another sentence.


you can use the files inside existing folders as an example if you want. when you are ready, edit the first variable of "main.py" (sim_var), 
and continue with its instrucctions, the last thing to do is execute the "main.py" file.
