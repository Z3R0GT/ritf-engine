Table of mods to run:
Order|	Name	| Type           | Objetive  |
1    |  Mod1    | partial control| chapter 1 |
2    |  Mod2    | total control  | chapter 1 |
3    |  Mod3    | partial control| chapter 2 |
If the type of mod is "partial", when the execution ends, then it will return to the chapter objetive, but if it is "total", then when its execution ends then it will go to the next chapter.

withour mods, the run of the game could be:

>start<
>chapter 1<
>chapter 2<
>chapter 3<

but with mods with partial control

>start<
>chapter 1 <---> mod 1, mod 2<
>chapter 2 <---> mod 3<
>chapter 3<


but this is the problema, what if a total mod is before of a partial mod.
in this case could be the next flow:

case 1: execute only the total mod
>start<
>mod 2< (Â´cause the mod 2 has total control)
>chapter 2 <---> mod 3<
>chapter 3<

but, the run could be like this:

case 2: excute the total and partial mod
>start<
>mod 2 <--> mod 1< 
>chapter 2 <---> mod 3<
>chapter 3<
