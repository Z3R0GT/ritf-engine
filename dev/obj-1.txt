n summary, when the game starts, check if there are folders within the "mods" directory, when the game detects these, it will enter "modified" mode, the names of the folders will be the names of the mods, each mod has a file of information, which contains the files that will be modified, the points where the game should give control to the mod.

In case the game detects if the mod requires a chapter from the base game, it copies and modifies it, telling the game something like "don't use chapter anymore, now replace it in your execution stack and put this one", otherwise, it will simply add this chapter depending on the position required, between chapter 1-3, 5-6 or at the end of the game
Logically, if they do not exist, the game runs as if nothing had happened
And regarding the flow of the story, that work will depend on the modder, since we will provide a tool to modify the game more easily and generate .rpy files, what happens next, he has to fix it
